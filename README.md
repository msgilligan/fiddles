Sean's Repo for jsFiddle.net
============================

This repo is for posting samples to http://jsFiddle.net

My public fiddles are here http://jsfiddle.net/user/msgilligan/fiddles/

The fiddles from this repository include:
http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jQuery/1.7.1/msgilligan/fiddles/tree/master/iui-helloworld/
http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jQuery/1.7.1/msgilligan/fiddles/tree/master/angular-hashdemo/

Notes
------
The iUI demo doesn't need jQuery. (and I think the Angular one doesn't need it either)
But this page: http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/github_read.html
is unclear about what the URL should look like for 'vanilla' JavaScript.
